# Project Title
Work on IoT_Botnet dataset
# Project Description
We simply applied four machine learning algorithms on IoT_Botnet dataset and observed which one is better and can be used in detection systems. The dataset is lablled and supervised algorithms are used. The algorithms used are CNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.
# How to use project
1. The files are notebook files so jupyter notebook IDE or Dataspell IDE is required.
2. You can install the dataset from this link. https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/umT99TnxvbpkkoE?path=%2FCSV%2FTraning%20and%20Testing%20Tets%20(5%25%20of%20the%20entier%20dataset)%2FAll%20features
Install the full5pc_4.
# Credits
It was a semester project with my partner Sarim Amir https://github.com/SarimAmir 
We took help from google and youtube for reference.
# How to contribute to project
We just applied some algorithms on a dataset. This can be used in a signature-based IDS.
